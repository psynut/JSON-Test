# JSON Test
 To serialize/deserialized specific class to/from JSON
 
 I've been working on an Unity app that serializes and deserializes answers to multiple items. The app has been thus far saving a class that is a lists of each item answered. Thus I have to deserialize multiple lists.
 
 I'm wondering if I've done this wrong, however (or ineffectively). Maybe I needed to make all the responses fit into class, to the serialize a list of the classes.
 
 This is to determine if I can do that in Unity...
 which of course will mean more work on my app if I can - to undo my mess.
